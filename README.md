# Titan Star Legends

This application was created to demonstrate state management using React, as well as SCSS and mobile styles.

This application displays a skill tree like you would see in a video game. You have a total of 6 points to allocate, and you can choose from skills in two different skill branches.

You can only assign a point to a skill if you have assigned points to any and all skills before it in its branch of the tree. You can only unassign points from skills if they are the last selected skill in the branch.

The orientation of the skill tree changes to vertical if the page is displayed on smaller screens.

## Running

After cloning the project, run:

```
npm install
npm start
```

The app will run on port 3000.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
